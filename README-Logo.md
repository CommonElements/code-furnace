# 🌋 Code Furnace - Volcanic Logo Design

The new Code Furnace logo embodies the **"Molten Core"** theme with a volcanic forge design that represents the power and intensity of our development environment.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The logo combines several symbolic elements:

- **🗻 Volcanic Forge**: The main body represents a volcanic forge where code is forged and refined
- **🔥 Molten Core**: The glowing center represents the AI-powered core that drives the application
- **⚡ Lava Cracks**: Dynamic energy flows showing the active, living nature of the development environment
- **💎 Obsidian Foundation**: Dark, solid base representing the robust Rust/Tauri foundation
- **✨ Floating Embers**: Sparks of creativity and innovation rising from the forge

## 🎨 Color Palette

The logo uses the complete Molten Core color scheme:

- **Lava Primary**: `#FF4500` (OrangeRed) - Main interactive elements
- **Lava Secondary**: `#FF8C00` (DarkOrange) - Secondary highlights  
- **Lava Gold**: `#FFD700` (Gold) - Accent highlights and sparks
- **Obsidian Dark**: `#0D0D0D` - Deep volcanic rock foundation
- **Obsidian Medium**: `#2D2D2D` - Structural elements
- **White Core**: Bright central focal point

- `icon.png` - Master 512px icon
- `icon.icns` - macOS bundle format
- `icon.ico` - Windows executable format

#### Windows Store Icons
- `Square30x30Logo.png` through `Square310x310Logo.png`
- `StoreLogo.png` - Windows Store listing

### Design Features

1. **Scalable Vector Design**: Clean appearance at all sizes from 16px to 1024px
2. **High Contrast**: Excellent visibility in both light and dark environments
3. **Rounded Corners**: Modern app icon aesthetics with 20% radius rounding
4. **Glow Effects**: Subtle luminescence that makes the icon stand out
5. **Cross-Platform**: Optimized for macOS, Windows, and Linux display

## 🛠️ Generation Process

The icons are generated using our custom Python script:

```bash
# Generate all icons from the volcanic design
python3 scripts/simple-icon-gen.py
```

This creates:
- ✅ 15+ icon files in multiple formats
- ✅ Platform-specific optimizations
- ✅ Proper sizing and anti-aliasing
- ✅ Consistent branding across all platforms

## 🌟 Visual Impact

3. **Thematic**: Perfect alignment with the Molten Core UI theme
4. **Memorable**: Unique visual metaphor that connects with "Code Furnace" branding
5. **Scalable**: Excellent visibility from system tray to splash screens

## 🚀 Integration

The logo is fully integrated into the Tauri configuration:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "icon": [
      "icons/32x32.png",
      "icons/128x128.png", 
      "icons/128x128@2x.png",
      "icons/icon.icns",
      "icons/icon.ico"
    ]
  }
}
```
